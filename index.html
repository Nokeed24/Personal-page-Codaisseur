        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>Full name: Nikolaos. Class of '84. Born in northern Greece to a Greek father and an
          Italian mother. Got the best and worst of both. I have a younger brother who serves as a best friend
          most of the time even though we are completely different. Fluent in 3 languages: Greek, Italian and English.
          Proficient cook (this is where you laugh). Jokes aside, i make a MEAN carbonara. I have lived away from
          home since the age of 18. First Italy (Parma) and then for a short period in Australia (Melbourne).
          My coding experience started with microcontroller programming in University, using C++ and Assembly and
          followed by various frameworks and languages. I'm in love with all things Python and would love to see
          Ruby on Rails get more use in the industry. Microsoft certified for software development fundamentals and
          have some experience in .NET web development using Entity and other frameworks. Other coding interests
          include the Unity engine and more recently, blockchain development has got me curious. I'm looking to
          expand my knowledge with Javascript and learning new ways and frameworks for web development.
          Seeing a new country is also nice. I would not consider myself a great developer, not even close, but
          i love challenge, solving problems and i for sure cosider myself better than your average Joe at using
          google to find what i need, quickly.</p>

          <h3>DJ/Music production</h3>
          <img src="images/dj.jpg" alt="Djing at positive River Festival" class="hobby-img js--wp-2">
          <p>In case it wasn't obvious enough, i love music.
            In collaboration with friends, i play in festivals,
            parties, rap battles and any occasion really.
            I've also worked as a studio assistant in a recording
            studio, organising events, mixing and producing music among other things.</p>

          <h3>Basketball</h3>
          <img src="images/basketball.jpg" alt="James Brown" class="hobby-img js--wp-2">
          <p>Basketball is my favorite sport. The mind games involved have fascinated me since i was a kid.
          By no means i'm not a great player but i try my best to have some fun. I know it's not very
          popular in the Netherlands, but then again, no one's perfect...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col span-1-of-3 hobby-box">
          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <img src="images/gaming.jpg" alt="James Brown" class="hobby-img js--wp-2">
          <p>This is what i usually do whenever i have some time to kill (sometimes even if i don't). I am probably gaming more than i should
          but i love almost ANY type of game and those greedy devs dish out so many great titles.
        I have to show some appreciation, don't you think?  </p>
